# About
So this is supposed to be a music player that just works—no fuss, no nonsense (well, maybe a little nonsense). You drag in a file or a whole folder, and boom, it plays. It also looks for this little file called album.cfg, and if it’s not there, it just makes one itself like a responsible adult. The cool part? While your music is playing, you can drag in an image, GIF, or even a video, and it’ll slap that onto the track so you’ve got some sweet visuals. It updates album.cfg automatically, so you never actually have to mess with it—unless you want to, but like... why would you? Anyway, it’s pretty neat. Enjoy.
